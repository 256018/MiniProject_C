# Requirements
## Introduction
- The Bank Account Management System is an application for maintaining a person's account in a bank. In this project I tried to show the working of a banking account system and cover the basic functionality of a Bank Account Management System. Some functions like creating a user's account, displaying details of bank account, searching a bank account are provided. 
- This topic is chosen because it helps me to explore one of the largest sector which is finanace and banking and it also helps me to revise and implement C programming concepts.

## Features and Benefits of project
A bank is a commercial or state institution that provides financila services, including issusing money in form of coins, banknotes, debit cards, receiving deposits of money, lending money and processing transactions. So what if we can do all major transaction without actually going to bank. This project is about that only which provides a simple command line interface and severals options to user to perform.

There are several benefits associated with bank management system some of which are listed below.

## Benefits
- It creates a user friendly environment, where normal user can access through all benefits of the system.
- It increases efficiency and saves time.
- Easy access to saved data inside the system.
- It is cost effective.
- It has a ease of use along with complete reference.

## SWOT ANALYSIS

# 4W&#39;s and 1&#39;H

## Who:
- Small or newly established bank can use this system to provide basic banking facilities to their customers.

## What:
- Many bank still follows a manual hand-written file system which sometimes become very diffficult to manage. If number of customers of a bank increases the traditional process becomes very tedious. So, digitalized banking system can come handy in such cases.

## When:
- The digitalization of banking sector started when Goverment of India launched digital India campaign. This campaign focuses on digital payments, online banking services etc. Since then many IT sectors are working continuously to achieve this dream. This project is also to contribution to this dream.

## Where:
- This project is likely to emerge in all banking and financial sectors.

## How:
- This project may sometime cause issue in creating and storing details of a customer due to issuses in network or due to some other technical glitch. But these problems are common when we are dealing with large number of people.
